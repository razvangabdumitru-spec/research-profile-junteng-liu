Suggestions

- Please open issues for new feature requests or corrections. Tag the issue with the appropriate label (e.g., 'enhancement', 'bug', 'paper').

- When adding project pages for publications, include an 'abstract.md', 'results.md', and 'reproduce.md' with clear instructions and links to the code.

- For CV updates, place a PDF in /assets and add a short summary in README.
